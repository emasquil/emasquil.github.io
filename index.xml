      <description>Today I’m writing some short thoughts on how to design solutions or decide on actions when you face a new problem.
TL;DR constantly ask yourself what you are trying to do.  One of the main lessons I’ve learned in this short time working in research (as an intern), is to be methodological. Especially when you are doing something from scratch, when there isn’t a clear roadmap, or when there is a lot of uncertainty and many options/things to do.</description>

      <title>Downloading files from S3 with multithreading and Boto3</title>

      <description>Yesterday I found myself googling how to do something that I&amp;rsquo;d think it was pretty standard: How to download multiple files from AWS S3 in parallel using Python?
After not finding anything reliable in Stack Overflow, I went to the Boto3 documentation and started coding. Something I thought it would take me like 15 mins, ended up taking me a couple of hours. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post with the hope I can help somebody who needs to perform this basic task and possibly me in the future.</description>
